# previous readme: 

hi so this is a little thing I made. the previous readme took itself too seriously so this one exists now. basically you plug in your advantagekit logs and poof you get data and pdf 
files and speradsheets and it tells you what to tune your shooter coefficents to based on real world data from your robot! Hopefully!

also this accidentially accounts for lack of a perfect world.
basically, bc it selects constants baesd on what works not what makes logical sense, it just kinda fudges in the corrections that make it work in practice
@mstatistics

so basically it accidentially solves our issue i think 
dont quote me on this
but it should work
